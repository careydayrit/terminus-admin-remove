# Terminus Admin Delete Script

## Project Functionality

A simple bash script that queries all Orgs and Sites you're associated with but no longer want to be. It then removes the org or site from your account via Terminus

## Project Purpose

Customer Success Engineers at Pantheon regularly do add themselves to a site to access certain information about a site while debugging issues and assisting customers. This tool is a quick scrip they can run occasionally to clean up their account, to remove their explicit access to sites they no longer need to access.
